<h1>The Best Movies According to Abbie</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Suits</h3>
 <p>I just really love to watch intelligent and professional movies.I love the showcase of law and all the manipulations. Just when you think it is over for Harvey Specter, he finds a way out.He made me enjoy that series a little too much.</p>

 <h3>The Good Doctor</h3>
 <p>Another movie that showed great expertise and intelligence. It reminded me of my childhood dream of becoming a medical Doctor.I also liked how they showcased the fact that we are all unique with our unique abilities. I loved Shawn Murphey in particular,he went all out and broke all odds. </p>

 <h3>Power</h3>
 <p>I am a huge fan of intelligence, no matter how you use it. I just like very intelligent people and yes that was why I fell in love with Ghost. A very good watch</p>
